/// \brief Declaration of the ControllerNode class, a ROS 2 lifecycle node for calculating speeds tasks in Easy Navigation.

/**
 * @class ControllerNode
 * @brief ROS 2 lifecycle node that manages calculating speeds for the Easy Navigation system.
 *
 * This node provides the interface between the controller module in EasyNav and the ROS 2 ecosystem.
 * It handles lifecycle transitions, real-time scheduling of periodic tasks, and parameter setup.
 *
 * It is also the single point where the velocity command leaves EasyNav:
 * - it owns the robot limits ("robot_limits.*"), which controller plugins query through
 *   ControllerMethodBase::get_robot_limits();
 * - every RT cycle, publish_cmd_vel_rt() selects the command (VelocityMux: override > takeover >
 *   pause > controller), smooths it within those limits (except an override) and publishes it
 *   on "cmd_vel" (or "cmd_vel_stamped", see "use_cmd_vel_stamped");
 * - on deactivation or shutdown, it brakes within the deceleration limits and ends by
 *   publishing an exact zero.
 *
 * safety::CommandGuard keeps the command from being stale or invalid ("cmd_timeout",
 * "cmd_vel_keepalive_period", non-finite commands, "diagnostics.cmd_vel").
 *
 * The safety channel's state in NavState ("safety_status", see SafetyChannelState) is applied
 * every RT cycle: zero during a protective stop, and the robot limits cut down to its safely
 * limited speed.
