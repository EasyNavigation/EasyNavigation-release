/**
 * @class RecoveryManagerNode
 * @brief ROS 2 lifecycle node that hosts EasyNav's recovery system, a RecoveryManagerBase plugin.
 *
 * Like ControllerNode or PlannerNode host their plugin, this node hosts the recovery system
 * chosen with "recovery_manager.plugin" (default "easynav_recovery/DummyRecoveryManager", which
 * does nothing; EasyNav's default recovery system is easynav_default_recovery, in
 * easynav_plugins), loaded on every configure and released on cleanup, so the whole recovery
 * system can be replaced by configuration. It forwards EasyNav's cycles and activation to it, and hands it
 * the SystemActions it may take (set by SystemNode).
 *
 * Owned by SystemNode and cycled on its loops, in the same process as the rest of the
 * navigation stack, so the recovery system reads NavState with no IPC latency.
